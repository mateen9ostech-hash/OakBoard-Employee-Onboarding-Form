              <h2>Scope</h2>
              <p>This privacy notice applies to the OakBoard Employee Onboarding Plan application operated for Oak Street Technologies. It covers account registration, authentication, plan creation and storage, PDF generation, and user-requested email delivery.</p>

              <h2>Information we process</h2>
              <p>OakBoard processes your work email address, name, authentication and session data, and the onboarding content you enter or import. Plan content may include role titles, reporting relationships, collaborators, dates, weekly goals, daily activities, and expected outcomes.</p>

              <h2>How information is used</h2>
              <p>The application uses this information to verify your work account, keep you signed in, save and retrieve your own plans, generate previews and PDFs, restore archived plans, and send a plan when you explicitly request email delivery. Information is also used to secure, troubleshoot, and maintain the service.</p>

              <h2>Storage and service providers</h2>
              <p>Supabase provides authentication, database storage, row-level access controls, and the server-side email function. Vercel hosts the web application. Resend processes recipient and message information when you ask OakBoard to email a PDF. These providers process data only as needed to operate their part of the service.</p>

              <h2>Cookies and browser storage</h2>
              <p>OakBoard uses essential authentication cookies and limited browser storage for session preference, remembered email choice, pending signup verification, and short-lived interface state. These technologies support sign-in and application continuity; they are not used for targeted advertising.</p>

              <h2>Access, retention, and deletion</h2>
              <p>Plans remain associated with your account until they are deleted or removed under company retention practices. Archiving hides a plan from the active list but keeps it available for restoration. Confirming Delete permanently removes the selected plan from the application database. For account-level access, correction, export, or deletion requests, contact support.</p>

              <p>OakBoard restricts access through work-email verification, authenticated sessions, server-side checks, and database policies. No online service can guarantee absolute security. Use accurate business information, avoid adding unnecessary sensitive personal data, and sign out on shared devices.</p>
