# OST Workforce Onboarding MySQL Database

This directory contains OST Workforce Onboarding's complete cPanel MySQL schema. The first deployment has no legacy users or plans to import.

## Requirements

- MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.6+
- InnoDB, `utf8mb4`, and JSON support
- PHP 8.1+ with PDO MySQL and cURL

## Setup

1. Import `schema.sql` using phpMyAdmin or the MySQL CLI.
2. Create `/home/CPANEL_USER/oakboard-config.php` from `api/config.example.php`.
3. Add the private database, session, and Mailgun values.
4. Build the app and deploy only `dist/`.
5. Test signup, OTP, recovery, owner isolation, CRUD, PDF, and email.

MySQL is the system of record for users, password hashes, sessions, one-time tokens, plans, and email logs. Passwords use PHP's password API; raw passwords and raw session tokens are never stored.

## Migrations

`schema.sql` always describes the current structure, so a fresh import needs
nothing else. An **existing** database is upgraded by running the files in
`migrations/` in filename order, once each, before deploying the release that
needs them.

| Migration | Required for |
| --- | --- |
| `2026-07-28-add-user-role.sql` | Admin console. Adds `app_users.role`. |
| `2026-07-29-add-must-change-password.sql` | Forced password change for administrator-created accounts. Adds `app_users.must_change_password`. |
| `2026-08-17-expand-plan-duration.sql` | Allows onboarding plans and imports from 1 through 8 weeks. |
| `2026-08-17-user-profiles.sql` | Adds name, role, department, phone, timezone, and profile-image fields. |

The application reads these columns at runtime, so apply every migration required
by the release **before** deploying its frontend and PHP API.

Never add real credentials to Git, screenshots, chat messages, `.env` files, or the public document root.
